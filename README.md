# queries/insights.sql â€“ Analytical Queries
1. Top 5 Most Played Tracks (All Time)
   ```bash
    SELECT t.title AS track_title, a.title AS album_title, ar.name AS artist_name, t.play_count
FROM tracks t
JOIN albums a ON t.album_id = a.album_id
JOIN artists ar ON a.artist_id = ar.artist_id
ORDER BY t.play_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
Insight: Understand which tracks have been most played historically for royalty distribution or recommendations.
2. Recent Listening Activity by a User
``` SELECT u.username, t.title AS track_title, ar.name AS artist_name, lh.listened_at
FROM listening_history lh
JOIN users u ON lh.user_id = u.user_id
JOIN tracks t ON lh.track_id = t.track_id
JOIN albums al ON t.album_id = al.album_id
JOIN artists ar ON al.artist_id = ar.artist_id
WHERE u.username = 'musicfan1'
ORDER BY lh.listened_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Insight: View recent engagement for personalization or user-specific dashboard.
3.  Most Followed Artists 
```SELECT ar.name AS artist_name, COUNT(f.user_id) AS follower_count
FROM follows f
JOIN artists ar ON f.artist_id = ar.artist_id
GROUP BY ar.artist_id, ar.name
ORDER BY follower_count DESC
LIMIT 5;
 ```
Insight: Identify top artists by follower count to prioritize for homepage visibility, promotional deals, etc.
4. Top Genres by Number of Tracks
SELECT g.name AS genre, COUNT(tg.track_id) AS num_tracks
FROM genres g
JOIN track_genres tg ON g.genre_id = tg.genre_id
GROUP BY g.genre_id, g.name
ORDER BY num_tracks DESC;
Insight: Discover dominant genres in your catalog for genre-based curation or playlist strategy.
5.  Most Popular Albums (by Total Plays)
```SELECT a.title AS album_title, ar.name AS artist_name, SUM(t.play_count) AS total_album_plays
FROM albums a
JOIN tracks t ON a.album_id = t.album_id
JOIN artists ar ON a.artist_id = ar.artist_id
GROUP BY a.album_id, a.title, ar.name
ORDER BY total_album_plays DESC
LIMIT 5;
 ```
Insight: Reveal which albums are resonating most with users.
6.  Subscribed vs Free Users Count
``` SELECT plan, COUNT(*) AS user_count
FROM subscriptions
GROUP BY plan;
```
Report: Measure adoption rate of premium plans vs free-tier users.
7. Active Users by Listening History Count
```SELECT u.username, COUNT(lh.track_id) AS tracks_played
FROM users u
JOIN listening_history lh ON u.user_id = lh.user_id
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.username
ORDER BY tracks_played DESC;
```
Report: Evaluate user engagement levels and identify your power users.
8. Most Recent Album by Each Artist
```SELECT ar.name AS artist_name, al.title AS album_title, al.release_date
FROM (
    SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY artist_id ORDER BY release_date DESC) AS rn
    FROM albums
) al
JOIN artists ar ON al.artist_id = ar.artist_id
WHERE al.rn = 1
ORDER BY ar.name;
 ```
Report: Lists latest album releases per artist, useful for newsletters or home banners.
